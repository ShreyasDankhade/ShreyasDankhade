## Hey there 👋
# It's Shreyas Dankhade

An computer science undergrad who treats semicolons like a necessary evil and believes Java’s _“write once, run anywhere”_ slogan should include _“…except when it doesn’t, but we’ll blame your OS anyway.”_. When I’m not accidentally creating infinite loops or arguing with my IDE about syntax, I’m probably knee-deep in projects that oscillate between “genius” and “why did I think this was a good idea?”

What I Bring to the Table:

💻 Code that mostly compiles on the first try (disclaimer: _“mostly”_ is doing heavy lifting here).

🧠 A passion for problem-solving—whether it’s optimizing the code or figuring out why the printer hates me.

☁️ Cloud, AI/ML, and web dev dabbling—because why specialize when you can panic-switch frameworks at 2 AM?

🤝 Team collaboration skills—I speak fluent Git, including dialect phrases like **`Who force-pushed over my changes?`**

Current Obsessions:

Debugging why my Spring Boot app thinks "production" is a suggestion.

Teaching neural networks to judge my Spotify playlists (they’re brutal).

Writing code comments that are 50% documentation, 50% existential crisis.

Trying to convince my own self that **`sudo make me a sandwich`** should work.

Let’s Connect If You…

Want to geek out about tech, or the best way to hide veggies in pastas (priorities).

Need a collaborator who laughs in the face of merge conflicts.

Just really love puns. Array of sunshine, anyone?

P.S. My DMs are open for project ideas, memes, or proof that you, too, have cried over a missing curly brace.
