## Hey there 👋
# It's Shreyas Dankhade
`🚀 Code Connoisseur | ☕ Professional Caffeine Consumer | 🐛 Bug Whisperer Extraordinaire`

An computer science undergrad who’s mildly convinced that semicolons are just tiny winking punctuation judges here to critique my life choices. When I’m not accidentally creating infinite loops or arguing with my IDE about syntax, I’m probably knee-deep in projects that oscillate between “genius” and “why did I think this was a good idea?”

What I Bring to the Table:

💻 Code that mostly compiles on the first try (disclaimer: “mostly” is doing heavy lifting here).

🧠 A passion for problem-solving—whether it’s optimizing algorithms or figuring out why the printer hates me.

☁️ Cloud, AI/ML, and web dev dabbling—because why specialize when you can panic-switch frameworks at 2 AM?

🤝 Team collaboration skills—I speak fluent Git, including dialect phrases like “Who force-pushed over my changes?”

Current Obsessions:

Teaching neural networks to judge my Spotify playlists (they’re brutal).

Writing code comments that are 50% documentation, 50% existential crisis.

Trying to convince my rubber duck that sudo make me a sandwich should work.

Let’s Connect If You…

Want to geek out about tech, hackathons, or the best way to hide veggies in ramen (priorities).

Need a collaborator who laughs in the face of merge conflicts.

Just really love puns. Array of sunshine, anyone?

P.S. My DMs are open for project ideas, memes, or proof that you, too, have cried over a missing curly brace.
